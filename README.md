This app will help abandoned animals get help from Animal welfare organizations
all over the world when people reporting them via this app.
This project was initally created to participate in my first hackathon - Clerk
x Hashnode Hackathon July 2021. Check out [my article](https://yuridevat.hashnode.dev/sos-animals-hackathon-project)
about the project and my experience in the hackathon.

üèÜ This project was one of the Runner Up Winners. ü•≥

The idea is that when reporting an animal, the user will start filling out a form
about the animal's situation and location.
If people want to leave their contact information in the last stage, this should
give them the possibility to stay connected with the NGOs and get information
about the condition of the animal.
When submitting the form, the form should be sent to the nearest NGO station.

To participate in the Hackathon, it was a requirement to implement Clerk
Authantication, but it was finally removed because no authantication should be
necessary to use the app, to make sure to help the animal as fast as possible.
